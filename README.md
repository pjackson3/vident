# Vident
## About
Vident (latin for "they see") is a component library for jQuery. It implements the [mustache](https://mustache.js.org) templating engine. Under the hood, it uses a small client-side router called [page](https://npmjs.com/package/page). You will not need to interact with page to use this library. The router included wraps around it and should suffice for most purposes.

## Contributing
Currently the most needed area is the documentation. Another thing I would like to add in later versions is a virtual DOM (like the ones in React and Angular).
